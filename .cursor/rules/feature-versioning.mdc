# New feature workflow (versioning)

When the user asks to **create**, **add**, or **implement** a new feature:

1. **Remind them to use a feature branch** (or create it if they want):
   - Suggest: `git checkout -b feature/short-name` (e.g. `feature/dark-mode`, `feature/export-azkar`).
   - If the repo is not initialized, suggest the one-time setup from cursor.md first.

2. **Do the feature work** on the assumption they are (or will be) on a feature branch — implement the code as requested.

3. **After making code changes**, remind them to commit on the branch:
   - `git add . && git commit -m "Add <feature summary>"`

This keeps `main` (or their tagged baseline) unchanged so they can always go back. Full instructions are in **cursor.md** at the project root.
